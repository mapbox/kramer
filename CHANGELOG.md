# Changelog

## 2.0.0

- **Breaking:** Remove remark-reference-links, so when formatting link URLs will be inlined instead of footnote-style. The footnote-style links caused too many Git annoyances, with diffs and conflicts.
- **Breaking:** Remove remark-lint-file-extension, remark-lint-no-tabs, all of which have proven unnecessary.

## 1.0.0

- First public package release. Start this changelog.
